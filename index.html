			In the preliminary results of <em>census 2016</em>, the Central Statistics Office published a 
			<a id="cso-chart" title="" href="https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cpr/censusofpopulation2016-preliminaryresults/geochan/#highchartDiv107506">vivid chart</a> depicting proportional representation in Ireland while making the following statement:
			<blockquote>
				Based on the preliminary population count of 4,757,976 persons and the current total of 158 TDs the average number of persons per TD for the country as a whole now sits at 30,114, above the constitutional limit of 30,000.
			</blockquote><br>

			In section 3.2 of their <a href="http://www.constituency-commission.ie/docs/Constituency%20Commission%20Report%202017.pdf">report</a> on 27 June 2017 the Constituency Commission made the following stunning observation:<br>
			<blockquote>
				Total Dáil membership ... stood at 166 from the 1980 revision ...The 2016 population at 4,761,865 is 1,393,648 (+41%) greater than in 1979. ... The Commission recommends that the total number of members of Dáil Éireann should be 160.
			</blockquote><br>
			<p>
				Below is a chart of the representative ratio since the Republic was established.
			</p>
			<p>
				Following is an app allowing exploration of the recent evolution of Dáil constituencies and TD-population ratios through a interavtive timeline and map.

		with reference to the most obvious interpretation article ##.## of Bunreacht na hEireann. We note that the conditions in the above article are not specified to apply on a constituency basis or otherwise. <br> 

			
		We also note that the current government enacted changes to boundaries 
		We notice that the conditions of the constituency commission were also set by this Act eventhough they are usually set by a separate Act. 
	
		<p>
			On December 23rd 2017, Dáil Éireann passed Act... ... imposing terms on the next Constituency Commisson and placing limits on TD numbers to be considered. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We notice that the current Dáil will be disolved prior to the results of the next census. The next Constituency Commission will not be established before publication of the results of the next census. The results of the next census may require revision of the limits imposed by the above act. Historically, legislation on terms of the Constituency Commission had not been passed prior to publication of census results.
